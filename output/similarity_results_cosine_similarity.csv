PRINCIPAL DEVELOPER,LiquidX,"Boston, MA","Location: Boston The Role and Mindset: Liquid X is seeking to hire a Principal Developer (PD) capable of designing, architecting and developing world-class code along a full stack across clouds (AWS, IBM and Azure). The individual will serve in a senior capacity as an individual contributor who focuses on development and architecture in the most sophisticated and complex streams of work in our blockchain-based marketplace trading platform. The role is suited for top technical talent focused on engineering and problem solving… it is for those who love hands-on coding. Over his/her career the PD will have run the gamut of roles in the development lifecycle and has evolved from developer to technical architect and now operates as both architect (20-30%) and developer (70-80%). However, the individual should be able to serve as, if necessary, purely a Principal level architect (100%) working either on one or across a range of projects or as a pure developer (100% hands-on coding) of exceptionally unique engineering solutions. The PD would need to come up to speed and distill the architectural design-focused work from development and then run with a full analysis, options generation and recommendations on a SCRUM/project team. The PD would, if necessary, based on priority, be able to jump in and work with the rest of the team on a development stream whereby he/she would implement those recommendations. The level of expertise and experience is at a level that would be able to operate across technology/projects and be relatively agnostic to specific technology selections. The successful candidate will have delivered multiple architectures ranging from trading to real-time web and/or other platforms/form factors. Architecture at this level is expected to included best practices for the type of design (ie, serverless/lambda/functions, etc.). The candidate would be familiar with best design patterns for various architectural designs that lead to highly scalable, high performant, secure and ‘expiration-resistant’ designs. Responsibilities: Core Responsibility is ‘simply’ to build exceptional software in a highly rewarding and strategically differentiated environment while operating at the most seasoned and senior levels in a pure technology development team. The role has the breadth of responsibility to look at designing and building the end-to-end type services that drive our next generation unified platform. The individual would work to deliver the best solution possible and support your team members and the drive the mission of the overall organization to revolutionize markets through digitization and automation of trade finance. Serving as a senior technical subject matter expert in application development. This includes owning the end-to-end delivery of assigned blocks of work and also the more abstract activities required to craft sophisticated solutions at the level of technical/infrastructure complexity at which our team works/operates. The PD will be able to keep up and challenge other team members in technical solutions and/or analytical mindset such that complete and extremely well crafted and thoughtful solutions have been collaboratively build with the technology team. Qualifications: The PD has a clear track record of delivering over the span of his/her career by building exceptional applications across a multitude of technologies and architectures that support mission critical applications for tier 1 global clients. The PD is sufficiently seasoned that the slight nuances and subtleties between tools/languages are well understood however the PD is most focused on crafting unique solutions that offer quick turn around delivery cycles coupled with scalability, extensibility and the absolutely essential flexibility of a unified platform. While we at Liquid X are using a range of these technologies right now we are making technology decisions that may include some of the following and also others that are new and/or excluded from this list. Front-end/Web SPA-Experiences: Angular 6, Typescript, React, JQuery, other JS frames but Angular is essential and deepest (ideally with React as a fast-follow) in 2020. Various libraries and open-source add-ons are essential to designing and building a highly flexible and scalable web framework that is coupled to a fine-grained entitlements system. Mid-Tier/App: Lambda/Azure functions in a serverless cloud application coupled with traditional VM’s running .NET/C# and/or Java/Javascript/NodeJS. Other mid-tier services include: Hyperledger, Corda, Quorum, Ethereum, Mulesoft, Camel, Informatica, Dapper, Entity Frame, etc. Data Tier: Postgres / SQL Azure with deep relational skills and also No SQL/Doc Database such as Mongo, Couchbase, Cosmos, Aurora, etc… Other high performance data solutions such as Memcache, Reddis, etc… and other use-case specific data stores such as Azure blob and/or AWS blob stores. Cloud Services: AWS Lambda, Azure Fabric/Logic Apps, Azure Logic Apps, IBM Hyperledger Fabric, various IaaS/PaaS/Saas (cloud messaging, claims-based authentication services such as Azure AD and AWS Cognito as well as other open auth platforms (JWT, Okta, etc.) Dev Tools &amp; Devops: Create intelligent and adaptable release scripts and configurations for use everywhere from local development through dev/qa CI and into production using any combination of Chef, Maven, Munin, Ant, Fabric or shell scripts driven by Jenkins.

We are focused on generating and activating data from a variety of sources, including clinical, social, behavioral and the real world, to arrive at the best solutions for a person based on a comprehensive view of the evidence. Our unique expertise and capabilities in technology, data science and healthcare enable the entire healthcare ecosystem to drive better health outcomes. Description As a Data Scientist on our Registries and RWD (real-world data) team, you will be supporting our core mission to drive innovation in evidence generation for research and care decisions. We are building new types of longitudinal datasets that have foundations of RWD sources, such as EHRs (electronic health records) and claims data, and are augmented with prospective data collection. You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data. Responsibilities Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
